# Creative AI Workshop

In this workshop we're going to play with some applications of AI for generation.



## Exercise 1 - Style Transfer

If you have not already done so, setup Python, Tensorflow and Keras on your machine.  Install links can be found [here](../setup.md).

Make an image of the Hogeschool Rotterdam in the style of Van Gogh.  Use the Keras example [here](https://github.com/computerscienceretreat/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py).
